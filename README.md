# Mithril file tree example  
I was having some trouble figuring out how to get a file tree to work in [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/).  After digging around a little I found some parts of mithril that are a bit hidden which make file trees easier to create.  Feel free to use this code as a reference, or just copy it.  

Idea was based around Vue's [Tree View Example](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/tree-view.html)
